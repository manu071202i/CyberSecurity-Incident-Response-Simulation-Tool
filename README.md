Here's the very first project of mine attached:
"CyberSecurity Incident Response Simulation Tool"
Cybersecurity Incident Response Simulation Tool
This tool will provide an interactive simulation environment for users to practice their cybersecurity incident response skills. It will present various incident scenarios and guide the user through the phases of incident response, providing feedback on their decisions.
Key Features:
1.	Incident Scenarios:
o	Pre-defined incident types (e.g., Phishing Attack, Malware Infection, Data Breach, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)).
o	Each scenario will have a brief description of the initial alert or observation.
2.	Interactive Response Phases:
o	The simulation will guide the user through the standard incident response lifecycle:
	Preparation: (Implicit, as the user is using the tool to prepare)
	Identification: Users will identify the nature and scope of the incident.
	Containment: Users will decide on actions to limit the damage.
	Eradication: Users will select steps to remove the threat.
	Recovery: Users will choose actions to restore systems and data.
	Post-Incident Analysis: Users will review their response and identify lessons learned.
3.	Decision Points & Feedback:
o	At each phase, the user will be presented with multiple-choice options or prompts for action.
o	Choosing an action will trigger immediate feedback, explaining the consequences (positive or negative) of their decision.
o	The simulation will adapt slightly based on previous choices, creating a dynamic experience.
4.	Score and Summary:
o	Upon completion of a scenario, the tool will provide a summary of the user's choices, highlighting effective and ineffective actions.
o	A simple scoring mechanism could be implemented to reflect the efficiency and correctness of their response.
5.	Clean and Responsive User Interface:
o	The application will feature a modern, intuitive design built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring it looks great and is easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
How it will work:
1.	The user selects an incident scenario from a list.
2.	The simulation begins with the "Identification" phase, presenting initial information.
3.	The user makes decisions by selecting options.
4.	Feedback is provided for each decision, explaining its impact.
5.	The simulation progresses through "Containment," "Eradication," "Recovery," and "Post-Incident Analysis."
6.	Finally, a summary report is displayed, showing the outcome of their incident response.
This project will effectively demonstrate your ability to design and implement a complex interactive application, combining technical skills with an understanding of cybersecurity best practices.

Here's a summary of what has been built:
•	Three-View Structure: The app is divided into Scenario Selection, Simulation, and Summary views.
•	Interactive Scenarios: I've fully implemented two scenarios ("Phishing Attack" and "Malware Infection") with five distinct phases each, following the standard incident response lifecycle.
•	Dynamic Content: All text, choices, and feedback are loaded dynamically from a JavaScript object, making it easy to add more scenarios or modify existing ones.
•	Feedback & Scoring: Each choice you make provides immediate, colour-coded feedback and adjusts your score. The final summary presents your overall performance with a doughnut chart and key takeaways.
•	Responsive Design: The interface uses Tailwind CSS and is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
