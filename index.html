    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a multi-view, single-page architecture to guide the user through a linear simulation. The structure is: 1) Scenario Selection View: A main menu with cards for each incident, providing a clear entry point. 2) Simulation View: The core interactive part, displaying the incident phase, situation, choices, and feedback in a focused layout. A progress bar gives a sense of completion. 3) Summary View: A final screen showing results, a performance chart, and key takeaways. This task-oriented, step-by-step flow was chosen for its clarity and effectiveness in a learning/training context, preventing information overload and making the user journey intuitive. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Incident Scenarios -> Goal: Organize -> Viz: Interactive HTML/CSS Cards -> Interaction: Click to start -> Justification: Clear, distinct entry points. | Report Info: Response Phases -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: HTML/CSS Progress Tracker -> Interaction: Auto-updates -> Justification: Constant orientation for the user. | Report Info: Decision Points -> Goal: Engage/Interact -> Viz: HTML Buttons -> Interaction: Click to choose -> Justification: Standard, accessible interaction for choices. | Report Info: Feedback -> Goal: Inform/Teach -> Viz: Dynamic Text Block -> Interaction: Appears on choice -> Justification: Immediate learning reinforcement. | Report Info: Final Score -> Goal: Summarize/Compare -> Viz: Chart.js Doughnut Chart -> Interaction: Static display -> Justification: Visually engaging summary of performance. | CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used.
